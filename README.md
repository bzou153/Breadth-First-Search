# Breadth-First-Search
The breadth first search algorithm explores all the neighbouring nodes of the current positions untill it reaches the end point.

Run code in main.m
The code will first generate a 'map' matrix by calling the map_convert function, with 1 repersenting the walls and 0 repersenting the path.
You can change the starting point and end point by changing the variables in main.m.
The BFS function will return a move count of the shortest path and generate a plot to display the workings of the algorithm.
